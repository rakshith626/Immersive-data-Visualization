                                        Immersive Data Visualisation 
Data visualisation is viewed by many people as a modern equivalent of visual communication. It involves the creation and study of the visual representation of data.
To communicate information clearly and efficiently, data visualization uses statistical graphics plots information graphs and other tools. Effective visualization helps users analyse
And reason about data and evidence. It makes complex data more accessible, understandable and usable. In this project we use immersive data visualisation which means the user can visualise and experience the data in  3-dimensional representation.
The data provided in this is all about the crop cultivation and their generic variations in each state of India in different seasons.
