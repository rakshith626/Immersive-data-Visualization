# Immersive data visualisation
Immersive Data Visualization is a new trend where data scientists can perceive and manipulate Spark-powered data in VR using new tools such as the Oculus Rift and Leap Motion. Virtual Reality presents many exciting opportunities for the perception and manipulation of the data we process. VR represents data not just in 3D, but in a 3D that you can reach out and touch, and feel. Whereas your computer screen can represent a flat 3D image, in VR these 3D images are tracked by your head movements. You have depth perception in VR. In this way, visualizing data such as graph data in 3-dimensions allows us to more effectively perceive this data, especially data with many many dimensions.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
Aframe.js and babylon.js
we use these technologies in order to make the visualisation of the data in a 3d view and  very realistic to the viewer. 


## A-frame JS
A-Frame supports most VR headsets such as Vive, Rift, Windows Mixed Reality, Daydream, GearVR, Cardboard, and can even be used for augmented reality. Although A-Frame supports the whole spectrum, A-Frame aims to define fully immersive interactive VR experiences that go beyond basic 360Â° content, making full use of positional tracking and controllers.-Frame is a web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences. Originally from Mozilla, A-Frame was developed to be an easy but powerful way to develop VR content. As an independent open source project, A-Frame has grown to be one of the largest and most welcoming VR communities.

## babylon.js
An open source 3D engine based on webGL and Javascript.
Easy to Try and Setup:
The quickest way to see how to use the engine is to head to the First Steps. For your own HTML project nothing needs to be installed on your computer and nothing needs to be installed by a client to run your program. See how simple it is with the getting started tutorial below. Check out the Index or the Features Section to see what is available. Build your first scene and develop it by following the Babylon 101 Course Then move on the find out how to do more. An overview of the documentation is at the bottom of the page.
WebGL:
Web Graphics Library, or WebGL, is a JavaScript API designed to render interactive 3D computer graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser, without the use of any plug-ins.
Javascript:
Also know as ECMAScript, JavaScript is a dynamic, prototype-based scripting language, with first-class functions. Widely used on client-side (and sometimes even server-side, like on this website!), Javascript is the language that BabylonJS is based on.
