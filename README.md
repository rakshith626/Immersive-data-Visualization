# Immersive data visualisation
Immersive Data Visualization is a new trend where data scientists can perceive and manipulate Spark-powered data in VR using new tools such as the Oculus Rift and Leap Motion. Virtual Reality presents many exciting opportunities for the perception and manipulation of the data we process. VR represents data not just in 3D, but in a 3D that you can reach out and touch, and feel. Whereas your computer screen can represent a flat 3D image, in VR these 3D images are tracked by your head movements. You have depth perception in VR. In this way, visualizing data such as graph data in 3-dimensions allows us to more effectively perceive this data, especially data with many many dimensions.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
Aframe.js and babylon.js
we use these technologies in order to make the visualisation of the data in a 3d view and  very realistic to the viewer. 


## A-frame JS
A-Frame supports most VR headsets such as Vive, Rift, Windows Mixed Reality, Daydream, GearVR, Cardboard, and can even be used for augmented reality. Although A-Frame supports the whole spectrum, A-Frame aims to define fully immersive interactive VR experiences that go beyond basic 360Â° content, making full use of positional tracking and controllers.-Frame is a web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences. Originally from Mozilla, A-Frame was developed to be an easy but powerful way to develop VR content. As an independent open source project, A-Frame has grown to be one of the largest and most welcoming VR communities.
